## üîç Technical Details

### GeeksForGeeks Support
The extension includes special handling for GeeksForGeeks' strict Content Security Policy (CSP):
- Uses direct DOM manipulation instead of script injection
- Implements a dedicated bridge script for GeeksForGeeks
- Provides robust editor detection and value setting
- Handles both Ace editor and textarea inputs

### Editor Bridges
The extension uses specialized editor bridges to interact with different code editors:
- Monaco Editor (used by LeetCode, HackerRank)
- Ace Editor (used by GeeksForGeeks, CodeChef)
- CodeMirror (used by various platforms)

### CSP Compliance
To work around Content Security Policy restrictions:
- Avoids inline script execution
- Uses message passing between content scripts and page context
- Implements direct DOM manipulation when necessary

## üîí Privacy & Security

- API keys are stored locally in your browser
- No data is collected or stored externally
- All processing happens in your browser

## üîç Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Verify your Gemini API key is valid
